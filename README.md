## Description

In order to facilitate a new text detection research, we introduce the Total-Text dataset [(ICDAR2017 paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10400) [(presentation slides)](http://cs-chan.com/doc/TT_Slide.pdf), which is more comprehensive than the existing text datasets. The Total-Text consists of 1555 images with more than 3 different text orientations: Horizontal, Multi-Oriented, and Curved, one of a kind.
