## Description

These codes are the official evaluation protocol implementation for Total-Text. Two methods are made available: Deteval and Pascal VOC protocols.

Newly added feature - 'Do not care' candidates filtering is now available in the latest python scripts.

--------Deteval----------
We recommend 0.7 and 0.6 for tr and tp threshold for a fairer evaluation with polygon ground-truth and detection format.

--------Pascal VOC----------
The conventional 0.5 threshold works fine.
